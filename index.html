      <p>Hi! My name is Denis Zhitnyakov. And I love making software.</p>

      <p>Why I decided so?</p>

      <p>
        Firstly because I already created two products which are used by 100
        000+ people all over the world. Here they are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://dolphin.ru.com" target="_blank">dolphin.ru.com</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://anty.dolphin.ru.com" target="_blank"
            >anty.dolphin.ru.com</a
          >
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Well secondly, even after this success and taking the products to the
        level of $1,500,000 in revenue annually, I'm still excited as a child at
        the thought of starting to create new things. Because. I love it, that's
        my role as a Creator.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, I'm going to create a grouping of Epic Engineers that will exist in
        the form of a DAO or something similar that is necessarily decentralized
        and technologically advanced. I haven't fully decided yet...
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyway, Epic Engineers will be a place where new products will be
        created with active community participation.
      </p>

      <p>
        And as these products are created, I will be actively and in-depth about
        the progress of development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now I have about 10 ideas on my startup shortlist, which I'm going
        to start soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Join our media, stay informed, and become part of our global grouping:
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://twitter.com/EngineersEpic" target="_blank">Twitter</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://discord.gg/gZqxdduzT4" target="_blank">Discord</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
